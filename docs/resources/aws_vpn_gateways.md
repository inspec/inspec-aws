# aws\_vpn\_gateways

Use the `aws_vpn_gateways` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of all Amazon VPN gateways. To audit a single AWS VPN gateway, use the `aws_vpn_gateway` (singular) resource.

## Syntax

An `aws_vpn_gateways` resource block collects a group of AWS VPN descriptions and then tests that group.

    describe aws_vpn_gateways
      it { should exist }
    end

### Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

## Properties

| Property | Description | Field |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
|vpn\_gateway\_ids          | List of unique identifiers that identifies a AWS VPN gateway.|
|states                     | List of the current state of the VPN gateway. Possible values are: `pending`, `available`, `deleting`, `deleted`. |
|types                      | List of the types of VPN connection the VPN gateway supports. |

## Examples

### Ensure that exactly three AWS VPN gateways exist

    describe aws_vpn_gateways do
      its('count') { should eq 3 }
    end

### Request the IDs of all AWS VPN gateways, then test in-depth using `aws_vpn_gateway`.

    aws_vpn_gateways.vpn_gateway_ids.each do |vpn_gateway_id|
      describe aws_vpn_gateway(vpn_gateway_id) do
        it { should exists }
        it { should be_attached }
      end
    end

## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the 'describe' method returns at least one result.

    describe aws_vpn_gateways.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test an entity that should not exist.

    describe aws_vpn_gateways.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end
