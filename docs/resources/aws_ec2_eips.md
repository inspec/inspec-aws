# aws\_eips

Use the `aws_eips` InSpec audit resource to test properties of some or all AWS Elastic IP addresses.

## Syntax

Verify that a public IP address exists.

    describe aws_ec2_eips do
      it { should exist }
    end

An `aws_eips` resource block uses an optional filter to select a group of Elastic IPs and then test that group.

## Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

See the [AWS documentation on Elastic IP (EIP)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-eip.html) for additional information.

| --- | --- |
| public_ip | The Elastic IP address, or the carrier IP address. |
| instance_id | The ID of the instance the address is associated with, if any. |
| allocation_id | The allocation ID for the address. |
| association_id | The association ID for the address. |
| domain | Indicates whether the address is for use in EC2-Classic (standard) or in a VPC (vpc). |
| network_interface_id | The ID of the network interface that the address is associated with, if any. |

## Examples

##### Ensure a Elastic IP(EIP) has Public IP.
    describe aws_ec2_eips do
      it { should exist }
    end

##### Match count of Elastic IP(EIP).
    describe aws_ec2_eips do
        its('count') { should eq 5 }
    end

##### Check Allocation ID whether it is correct or not
    describe aws_ec2_eips do
       its('allocation_ids') { should include "eipassoc-0ew2bc8cde18191da" }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

      it { should_not exist }
    end
