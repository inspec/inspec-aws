# aws_cloudwatchlogs_destination

Use the `aws_cloudwatchlogs_destination` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single specific AWS Logs destination.

The `AWS::Logs::Destination` resource type specifies a CloudWatch Logs destination. A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kinesis data stream) and enables you to subscribe that resource to a stream of log events.

## Syntax

Ensure that the destination name exists.

    describe aws_cloudwatchlogs_destination(destination_name_prefix: "DESTINATION_NAME") do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

`destination_name_prefix` _(required)_

The name of the destination.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on AWS::Logs::Destination.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-destination.html).

| destination_name    | The name of the destination. |
| target_arn          | The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the physical target where the log events are delivered (for example, a Kinesis stream). |
| role_arn            | The ARN of an IAM role that permits CloudWatch Logs to send data to the specified AWS resource. |
| access_policy       | An IAM policy document governing the Amazon Web Services accounts, which can create subscription filters against this destination. |
