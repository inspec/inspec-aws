# aws\_nat\_gateway

Use the `aws_nat_gateway` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a single AWS NAT gateway.

## Syntax

An `aws_nat_gateway` resource block declares the tests for a single AWS NAT gateway by id, name, vpc_id or subnet_id.

    describe aws_nat_gateway(id: 'nat-abc0123456789deff') do
      it { should exist }
    end 

    describe aws_nat_gateway(name: 'my-nat-gateway') do
      it { should exist }
    end

Multiple parameters can be provided for better granularity.

    describe aws_nat_gateway(vpc_id: 'vpc-abc01234', subnet_id: 'subnet-6789deff') do
      it { should exist }
    end


#### Parameters

At least one of the following parameters must be provided.
- id
- name
- subnet_id
- vpc_id

##### id

The value of the `nat_gateway_id` assigned by the AWS after the resource has been created.
This should be in the format of `nat-` followed by 8 or 17 hexadecimal characters and passed as an `id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

##### name

If a `Name` tag is applied to the NAT gateway, this can be used to lookup the resource.
This must be passed as a `name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.
If there are multiple NAT gateways with the same name, this resource will raise an error.

##### subnet_id

The ID of the subnet in which the NAT gateway is placed.
This should be in the format of `subnet-` followed by 8 or 17 hexadecimal characters and passed as an `subnet_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

##### vpc_id

The ID of the VPC in which the NAT gateway is located.
This should be in the format of `vpc-` followed by 8 or 17 hexadecimal characters and passed as an `vpc_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.


## Properties

|Property                    | Description |
| ---                        | --- |
|id                          | The ID of the NAT gateway. |
|name                        | The value of the `Name` tag. It is `nil` if not defined. |
|vpc\_id                     | The ID of the VPC in which the NAT gateway is located. |
|subnet\_id                  | The ID of the subnet in which the NAT gateway is placed. |
|tags                        | A hash, with each key-value pair corresponding to a NAT gateway tag. |
|nat\_gateway\_address\_set  | A hash of [NatGatewayAddress object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_NatGatewayAddress.html) that gives information about the IP addresses and network interface associated with the NAT gateway. |
|state                       | The sate of the NAT gateway. Valid values are: `pending`, `failed`, `available`, `deleting` and `deleted`.|

There are also additional properties available. For a comprehensive list, see [the API reference documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_NatGateway.html)

## Examples

##### Test that the NAT gateway is in `available` state

    describe aws_nat_gateway(name: 'my-nat-gateway') do
      its('state') { should eq 'available' }
    end
    
##### Test that the ID of the VPC is `vpc-1234567890abcdef1`

    describe aws_nat_gateway(id: 'nat-abc0123456789deff') do
      its('vpc_id') { should eq `vpc-1234567890abcdef1` }
    end
    
##### Test that the NAT gateway has a certain tag

    describe aws_nat_gateway(name: 'my-nat-gateway') do
      its('tags') { should include('environment' => 'dev') }
      its('tags') { should include('delete-at-10-pm') }         # Regardless of the value
    end
    
##### Test that the private IP address is `10.0.1.68`

    describe aws_nat_gateway(vpc_id: 'vpc-abc01234', subnet_id: 'subnet-12345678') do
      its('nat_gateway_address_set') { should include(:private_ip => '10.0.1.68') }
    end
