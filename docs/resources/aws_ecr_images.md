# aws\_ecr\_images

Use the `aws_ecr_images` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of all images in an AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository.
This resource is available in InSpec AWS resource pack version **[1.11.0](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-aws/releases/tag/v1.11.0)** onwards.

## Syntax

An `aws_ecr_images` resource block declares the tests for all images in an AWS ECR repository by the repository name.

    describe aws_ecr_images(repository_name: 'my-repo') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Parameters

The repository name must be provided. The ID of the registry is optional.

##### repository\_name _(required)_

The name of the ECR repository must satisfy the following constraints:
- Regex pattern `(?:[a-z0-9]+(?:[._-][a-z0-9]+)*/)*[a-z0-9]+(?:[._-][a-z0-9]+)*`.
- Minimum 2 and maximum of 256 characters long.

##### registry\_id _(optional)_

The 12-digit ID of the AWS Elastic Container Registry. If not provided, the [default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRepositories.html) registry is assumed.

## Examples

##### Ensure that there are exactly 3 images

    describe aws_ecr_images(repository_name: 'my-repo') do
      its('count') { should cmp 3 }
    end
    
##### Use this InSpec resource to request the digests of all images, then test in-depth using `aws_ecr_image`.

    aws_ecr_images(repository_name: 'my-repo').digests.each do |image_digest|
      describe aws_ecr_image(repository_name: 'my-repo', image_digest: image_digest) do
        its('tags') { should include('latest') }
      end
    end
    
## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

   
#### exist
The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_ecr_images(repository_name: 'my-repo').where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should exist }
    end
      
    describe aws_ecr_images(repository_name: 'my-repo').where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end
