# aws\_vpc

Use the `aws_vpc` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the CIDR Block that is used within the VPC.

Each VPC is uniquely identified by its ID. In addition, each VPC has a non-unique CIDR IP address range (such as 10.0.0.0/16), which it manages.

Every AWS account has at least one VPC, the "default" VPC, in every region.

## Syntax

An `aws_vpc` resource block identifies a VPC by ID. If no VPC ID is provided, the default VPC is used.

    # Find the default VPC
    describe aws_vpc do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Find a VPC by ID
    describe aws_vpc('vpc-12345678987654321') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Hash syntax for ID
    describe aws_vpc(vpc_id: 'vpc-12345678') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Parameters

If no parameter is provided, the subscription's default VPC will be returned.

##### vpc\_id _(optional)_

This resource accepts a single parameter, the VPC ID.
This can be passed either as a string or as a `vpc_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

See also the [AWS documentation on VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html).

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test the CIDR Block of a named VPC

    describe aws_vpc('vpc-87654321') do
      its('cidr_block') { should cmp '10.0.0.0/16' }
    end

### Test the state of the VPC

    describe aws_vpc do
      its ('state') { should eq 'available' }
      # or equivalently
      it { should be_available }
    end

### Test the allowed tenancy of instances launched into the VPC

    describe aws_vpc do
      its ('instance_tenancy') { should eq 'default' }
      it { should be_default_instance }
      it { should_not be_dedicated_instance }
      it { should_not be_host_instance }
    end

### Test tags on the VPC

    describe aws_vpc do
      its('tags') { should include(:Environment => 'env-name',
                                   :Name => 'vpc-name')}
    end

### Test if the IPV6 CIDR Block is associated to a named VPC

    describe aws_vpc do
      it { should have_ipv6_cidr_block_associated?(aws_ipv_6_cidr_block_association_set_ipv_6_cidr_block) }
    end

### Test if the CIDR Block is associated to a named VPC

    describe aws_vpc do
      it { should have_cidr_block_associated?(aws_cidr_block) }
    end

## AWS Permissions

To set the permission for the [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal), you need the `ec2:DescribeVpcs` action with effect set to `Allow`.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonec2.html).
