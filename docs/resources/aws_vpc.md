# aws\_vpc

Use the `aws_vpc` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Each VPC is uniquely identified by its VPC ID. In addition, each VPC has a non-unique CIDR IP Address range (such as 10.0.0.0/16) which it manages.

Every AWS account has at least one VPC, the "default" VPC, in every region.

## Syntax

An `aws_vpc` resource block identifies a VPC by id. If no VPC ID is provided, the default VPC is used.

    # Find the default VPC
    describe aws_vpc do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Find a VPC by ID
    describe aws_vpc('vpc-12345678987654321') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Hash syntax for ID
    describe aws_vpc(vpc_id: 'vpc-12345678') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Parameters

If no parameter is provided, the subscription's default VPC will be returned.

##### vpc\_id _(optional)_

This resource accepts a single parameter, the VPC ID. 
This can be passed either as a string or as a `vpc_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

See also the [AWS documentation on VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html).

## Properties

|Property         | Description|
| ---             | --- |
|cidr\_block       | The IPv4 address range that is managed by the VPC. |
|dhcp\_options\_id  | The ID of the set of DHCP options associated with the VPC (or `default` if the default options are associated with the VPC). |
|instance\_tenancy | The allowed tenancy of instances launched into the VPC. |
|state            | The state of the VPC (`pending` | `available`). |
|vpc\_id           | The ID of the VPC. |
|tags             | The tags of the VPC. |

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

##### Test the CIDR of a named VPC
    describe aws_vpc('vpc-87654321') do
      its('cidr_block') { should cmp '10.0.0.0/16' }
    end

### Test the state of the VPC
    describe aws_vpc do
      its ('state') { should eq 'available' }
      # or equivalently
      it { should be_available }
    end

##### Test the allowed tenancy of instances launched into the VPC.
    describe aws_vpc do
      its ('instance_tenancy') { should eq 'default' }
    end

##### Test tags on the VPC
    describe aws_vpc do
      its('tags') { should include(:Environment => 'env-name',
                                   :Name => 'vpc-name')}
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### be\_default

The test will pass if the identified VPC is the default VPC for the region.

    describe aws_vpc('vpc-87654321') do
      it { should be_default }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `ec2:DescribeVpcs` action with Effect set to Allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonec2.html).
