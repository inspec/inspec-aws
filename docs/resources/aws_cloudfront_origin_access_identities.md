# aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identities

Use the `aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identities` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS CloudFront origin access identities.

An origin access identity is a special CloudFront user that you can associate with Amazon S3 origins, so that you can secure all or just some of your Amazon S3 content.

## Syntax

Ensure that the identity exists.

    describe aws_cloudfront_origin_access_identities do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on AWS CloudFront CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudfront-cloudfrontoriginaccessidentity.html).

## Properties

| Property | Description | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ids | The ID for the origin access identity. | id |
| s3_canonical_user_ids | The Amazon S3 canonical user ID for the origin access identity, used when giving the origin access identity read permission to an object in Amazon S3. | s3_canonical_user_id |
| caller_references | A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures that the request can't be replayed. | caller_reference |
| comments | A comment to describe the origin access identity. | comment |

## Examples
