### Ensure a client VPN endpoint ID is available.

    describe aws_ec2_client_vpn_routes(client_vpn_endpoint_id: "CLIENT_VPN_ENDPOINT_ID") do
      its('client_vpn_endpoint_ids') { should include 'CLIENT_VPN_ENDPOINT_ID' }
    end

### Ensure that the status code is `active`.

    describe aws_ec2_client_vpn_routes(client_vpn_endpoint_id: "CLIENT_VPN_ENDPOINT_ID") do
        its('status_codes') { should include 'active' }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_ec2_client_vpn_routes(client_vpn_endpoint_id: "CLIENT_VPN_ENDPOINT_ID") do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

    describe aws_ec2_client_vpn_routes(client_vpn_endpoint_id: "CLIENT_VPN_ENDPOINT_ID") do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the entity is available.

    describe aws_ec2_client_vpn_routes(client_vpn_endpoint_id: "CLIENT_VPN_ENDPOINT_ID") do
      it { should be_available }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `EC2:Client:DescribeClientVpnRoutesResult` action with `Effect` set to `Allow`.
