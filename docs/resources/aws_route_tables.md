title: About the aws_route_tables Resource

# aws\_route\_tables

Use the `aws_route_tables` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of all route tables or a group of route tables, and all routes or a group of routes. A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

## Syntax

    describe aws_route_tables do
      it { should exist }
    end

### Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

See also the [AWS documentation on route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-route-table.html).

## Examples

### Confirm that a route table exists.

    describe aws_route_tables do
      its('vpc_ids') { should include 'VPC_ID' }
    end

### Confirm a route table exists.

    describe aws_route_tables do
      its('route_table_ids') { should include 'ROUTE_TABLE_ID' }
    end

### Confirm a destination_cidr_blocks is there in the routes.

    describe aws_route_tables do
      its('destination_cidr_blocks') { should include "IPV4_CIDR_BLOCK" }
    end

### Ensure subnet ID of interest is associated 

    describe aws_route_tables do
      its('associated_subnet_ids') { should include 'SUBNET_ID' }
    end

### Filter only main route tables

    describe aws_route_tables.where(main: true) do
      it { should exist }
    end

### Filter all failed associations

    describe aws_route_tables.where{ association_states.include?('associated') } do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Matchers

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_route_tables do
      it { should exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `EC2:Client:DescribeRouteTablesResult` action with `Effect` set to `Allow`.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonec2.html).
