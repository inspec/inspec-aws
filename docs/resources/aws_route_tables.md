# aws\_route\_table

Use the `aws_route_tables` InSpec audit resource to test properties of all or a group of Route Tables. A Route Table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

## Syntax

      # Ensure that there is at least one route table
      describe aws_route_tables do
        it { should exist }
      end
          
#### Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

See also the [AWS documentation on Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html).

## Properties

|Property          | Description|
| ---              | --- |
|route\_table\_ids | The route table IDs |
|vpc\_ids          | The VPC IDs |
|entries           | Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes. |

## Examples

##### Confirm that a route table exists
    describe aws_route_tables do
      its('vpc_ids') { should include 'vpc-01625e36123456789' }
    end

##### Confirm a Route Table exists.
    describe aws_route_tables do
      its('route_table_ids') { should include 'rtb-12345678' }
    end

## Matchers

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

      it { should exist }
 
      it { should_not exist }
