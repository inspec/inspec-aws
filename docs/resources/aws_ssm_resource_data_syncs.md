# aws_ssm_resource_data_syncs

Use the `aws_ssm_resource_data_syncs` InSpec audit resource to test properties of the plural resource of an AWS Systems Manager (SSM) resource data sync.

The `AWS::SSM::ResourceDataSync` resource creates, updates, or deletes a resource data sync for AWS Systems Manager. A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: `SyncToDestination` and `SyncFromSource`.

## Syntax

Ensure that the resource data syncs exists:

    describe aws_ssm_resource_data_syncs do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on AWS SSM ResourceDataSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ssm-resourcedatasync.html).

## Properties

| Property | Description | Fields | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| sync_names | The name of the resource data sync. | sync_name |

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The controls will pass if the `list` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_ssm_resource_data_syncs do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

    describe aws_ssm_resource_data_syncs do
      it { should_not exist }
    end
