# aws\_efs\_mount\_targets

Use the `aws_efs_mount_targets` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a plural EFS Mount Targets.

The AWS::EFS::MountTarget resource is an Amazon EFS resource that creates a mount target for an EFS file system. You can then mount the file system on Amazon EC2 instances or other resources by using the mount target.

## Syntax

Ensure that a file system exists.

    describe aws_efs_mount_targets(file_system_id: "FILE_SYSTEM_ID") do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

`file_system_id` _(required)_

The ID of the file system for which to create the mount target.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on EFS Mount Target](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-efs-mounttarget.html).

| --- | --- | --- |
| owner_ids | The owner IDs of the mount targets. |
| mount_target_ids | IDs of the file system whose mount targets you want to list (String). |
| file_system_ids | The IDs of the file system for which to create the mount target. |
| life_cycle_states | The life cycle states of the mount targets. |
| ip_addresses | Valid IPv4 addresses within the address range of the specified subnet. |
| network_interface_ids | The network interface IDs of the mount targets. |

## Examples

### Ensure a owner ID is available.

    describe aws_efs_mount_targets(file_system_id: "FILE_SYSTEM_ID") do
      its('owner_ids') { should include 'OWNER_ID' }
    end

### Ensure that the IP address is available.

        its('ip_addresses') { should include 'IP_ADDRESS' }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.
    describe aws_efs_mount_targets(file_system_id: "FILE_SYSTEM_ID") do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.
    describe aws_efs_mount_targets(file_system_id: "FILE_SYSTEM_ID") do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the file system is available.
    describe aws_efs_mount_targets(file_system_id: "FILE_SYSTEM_ID") do
      it { should be_available }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `EFS:Client:DescribeMountTargetsResponse` action with `Effect` set to `Allow`.
