# aws\_efs\_file_system

Use the `aws_efs_file_system` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a single AWS EFS file system.
This resource is added to InSpec AWS resource pack in version **[1.10.0](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-aws/releases/tag/v1.10.0)** and it is available with InSpec **[4.18.108](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/releases/tag/v4.18.108)** and later versions. 

## Syntax

An `aws_efs_file_system` resource block declares the tests for a single AWS EFS file system by either file system id or creation token.

    describe aws_efs_file_system(file_system_id: 'fs-12345678') do
      it                         { should be_encrypted }
      its('size_in_bytes.value') { should cmp 6144 }
    end

    describe aws_efs_file_system(creation_token: 'my-token') do
      its('encrypted')       { should cmp true }
      its('throughput_mode') { should eq 'bursting' }
    end

The value of the `file_system_id` can be provided as a string.  

    describe aws_efs_file_system('fs-12345678') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Parameters

Either the EFS file system id or creation token must be provided.

##### file\_system\_id _(required if `creation_token` not provided)_

The ID of the EFS file system. This is in the format of `fs-` followed by 8 or 17 hexadecimal characters.
This can be passed either as a string or as a `file_system_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

##### creation_token _(required if `file_system_id` not provided)_

The creation token is automatically assigned by AWS if not provided by the user at creation. 
This is a string with minimum 1 and maximum 64-character long.
This must be passed as a `creation_token: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

## Properties

|owner\_id            | The AWS account that created the file system. |
|performance\_mode    | The performance mode of the file system, e.g. 'maxIO'. |

## Examples

##### Test that an EFS file system is available

    describe aws_efs_file_system("fs-12345678") do
        its("life_cycle_state") { should eq 'available' }
    end
    

##### Test that an EFS file system is in 'maxIO' performance mode

    describe aws_efs_file_system(creation_token: "My Token") do
        its("performance_mode") { should eq "maxIO" }
    end
    
##### Test that an EFS file system has a certain tag

    describe aws_efs_file_system(creation_token: "My Token") do
        its("tags") { should include("companyName" => "My Company") }
    end
