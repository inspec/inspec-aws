# aws\_ecr\_repository

Use the `aws_ecr_repository` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a single AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository.
This resource is available in InSpec AWS resource pack version **[1.11.0](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-aws/releases/tag/v1.11.0)** onwards.

## Syntax

An `aws_ecr_repository` resource block declares the tests for a single AWS ECR repository by repository name.

    describe aws_ecr_repository(repository_name: 'my-repo') do
      it { should exist }
    end

The value of the `repository_name` can be provided as a string.  

    describe aws_ecr_repository('my-repo') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Parameters

The repository name must be provided. The registry id is optional.

##### repository\_name _(required)_

The name of the ECR repository must satisfy the following constraints:
- Regex pattern `(?:[a-z0-9]+(?:[._-][a-z0-9]+)*/)*[a-z0-9]+(?:[._-][a-z0-9]+)*`.
- Minimum 2 and maximum of 256 characters long.

This can be passed either as a string or as a `repository_name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

##### registry\_id _(optional)_

The 12-digit ID of the AWS Elastic Container Registry. If not provided, the [default](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRepositories.html) registry is assumed.
