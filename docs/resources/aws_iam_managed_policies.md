# aws_iam_managed_policies

Use the `aws_iam_managed_policies` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a collection of AWS IAM managed policies.

## Syntax

The `aws_iam_managed_policies` resource returns a collection of IAM managed policies and allows testing of that collection.

    describe aws_iam_managed_policies do
      its('policy_names') { should include('POLICY_NAME') }
    end

This resource allows filtering by scope, which are:

- To list only AWS-managed policies, set `scope` to `AWS`.
- To list only the customer-managed policies in your AWS account, set `scope` to `Local`.
- If a scope is not provided or if `scope` is set to `ALL`, all policies are returned.

    describe aws_iam_managed_policies(scope: 'AWS') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_iam_managed_policies(scope: 'Local') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_iam_managed_policies(scope: 'ALL') do
      it { should exist }
    end

See the [AWS documentation on IAM Managed Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-managedpolicy.html) for additional information.

## Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

`scope` _(optional)_

`scope` accepts three possible values, `AWS`, `Local`, or `ALL`:

- `AWS` returns AWS-managed policies.
- `Local` returns customer-managed policies.
- `ALL` returns all policies.

Specify a scope by passing a key-value entry in a hash: `scope: 'VALUE'`.

If omitted, all policies are returned.

## Examples

### Ensure a specific policy exists

    describe aws_iam_managed_policies do
      its('policy_names') { should include('POLICY_NAME') }
    end

### Allow at most 100 IAM Policies on the account

    describe aws_iam_managed_policies do
      its('polict_ids.count') { should be <= 100}
    end

## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exist

The control passes if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should` to test the entity should exist.

    describe aws_iam_managed_policies.where( PROPERTY: PROPERTY_VALUE) do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_iam_managed_policies.where( PROPERTY: PROPERTY_VALUE) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `iam:ListPolicies` action with Effect set to Allow.
