# aws\_cloudformation\_stack

Use the `aws_cloudformation_stack ` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS Cloud Formation Stack.

## Syntax

Ensure that an `aws_cloudformation_stack` exists

    describe aws_cloudformation_stack('stack-name') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_cloudformation_stack(stack_name: 'stack-name') do
      it { should exist }
    end
    
#### Parameters

##### stack\_name _(required)_

This resource accepts a single parameter, the CloudFormation Stack name which uniquely identifies the stack. 
This can be passed either as a string or as a `stack_name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

See also the [AWS documentation on Cloud Formation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

|drift\_information              | Information on whether a stack's actual configuration differs, or has drifted, from it's expected configuration, as defined in the stack template and any values specified as template parameters. |
|disable\_rollback               | Boolean to enable or disable rollback on stack creation failures: |

|root\_id                        | For nested stacks--stacks created as resources for another stack--the stack ID of the the top-level stack to which the nested stack ultimately belongs. |

## Examples

##### Test that a CloudFormation Stack has its stack_status configured correctly
    describe aws_cloudformation_stack('stack_name') do
    its ('stack_status')  { should eq 'CREATE_COMPLETE' }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has no special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_cloudformation_stack('AnExistingStack') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_cloudformation_stack('ANonExistentStack') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `cloudformation:DescribeStacks` action set to Allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Authentication and Access Control for CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)
