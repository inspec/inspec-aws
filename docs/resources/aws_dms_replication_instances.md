### exist

#### Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_dms_replication_instances do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

    describe aws_dms_replication_instances do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the work group name is available.

    describe aws_dms_replication_instances do
      it { should be_available }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `dmsmigrationservice:client:describe_orderable_replication_instances` action with `Effect` set to `Allow`.
