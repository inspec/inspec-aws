# aws\_api\_gateway\_deployments

Use the `aws_api_gateway_deployments` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single plural AWS ApiGateway Deployment.

The AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment resource deploys an API Gateway RestApi resource to a stage so that clients can call the API over the internet. The stage acts as an environment.

## Syntax

Ensure that the deployment exists.

    describe aws_api_gateway_deployments(rest_api_id: 'value') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

`rest_api_id` _(required)_

For additional information, see the [AWS ApiGateway Deployment documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-deployment.html).

## Properties

| Property | Description|
| --- | --- |
| ids | The identifier for the deployment resource. |
| descriptions | The description for the deployment resource. |
| created_dates | The date and time that the deployment resource was created. |
| api_summaries | A summary of the RestApi at the date and time that the deployment resource was created. |

## Examples

    describe aws_api_gateway_deployments(rest_api_id: 'value') do
      its('ids') { should include 'value' }
    end
