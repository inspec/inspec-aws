# aws\_efs\_file_systems

Use the `aws_efs_file_systems` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of some or all AWS EFS file systems. To audit a single EFS file system, use `aws_efs_file_ststem` (singular). 

This resource is added to InSpec AWS resource pack in version **[1.10.0](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-aws/releases/tag/v1.10.0)** and it is available with InSpec **[4.18.108](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/releases/tag/v4.18.108)** and later versions.

## Syntax

An `aws_efs_file_systems` resource block collects a group of EFS file system descriptions and then tests that group.

    describe aws_efs_file_systems
      it { should exist }
    end   
    
#### Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

## Properties

|Property             | Description|
| ---                 | --- |
|tags                 | The list of tags that the EFS file system has. |
|names                | The value of the `Name` (case sensitive) tag if it is defined. |
|file\_system\_ids    | The ID of the EFS file system. |
|creation\_tokens     | The creation token that the EFS file system is associated. |
|owner\_ids           | The owner id of the EFS file system. |
|entries              | Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes. |
|creation\_times      | The creation time of the EFS file system|
|performance\_modes   | The performance mode of the EFS file system, e.g. 'maxIO'.|
|encryption\_status   | This indicates whether the EFS file system is encrypted or not.|
|throughput\_modes    | The throughput mode of the EFS file system.|
|kms\_key\_ids        | The ID of an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that was used to protect the encrypted EFS file system. |
|size\_in\_bytes      | The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its `value` field. |
|life\_cycle\_states  | The life cycle phase of the EFS file system, e.g. 'deleting'. |

## Examples

##### Ensure you have exactly 3 file systems
    describe aws_efs_file_systems do
      its("entries.count") { should cmp 3 }
    end

##### Use this InSpec resource to request the IDs of all EFS file systems, then test in-depth using `aws_efs_file_system`.
    aws_efs_file_systems.file_system_ids.each do |file_system_id|
      describe aws_efs_file_system(file_system_id) do
        its("tags") { should include("companyName" => "My Company Name") }
        it { should be_encrypted }
        its("throughput_mode") { should eq "bursting" }
        its("performance_mode") { should eq "generalPurpose" }
      end
    end

## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/). 

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_efs_file_systems.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should exist }
    end
      
    describe aws_efs_file_systems.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end
