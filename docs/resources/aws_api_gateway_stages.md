# aws_api_gateway_stages

Use the `aws_api_gateway_stages` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS API Gateway stages.

The `AWS::ApiGateway::Stage` resource deploys an API Gateway REST API resource to a stage so that clients can call the API over the internet. The stage acts as an environment.

## Syntax

Ensure that the stage exists.

    describe aws_api_gateway_stages(rest_api_id: 'REST_API_ID') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

`rest_api_id` _(required)_

The ID of the REST API resource that you're deploying with this stage.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on the `AWS::ApiGateway::Stage` resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-stage.html).

## Properties

| Property  | Description | Field |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| deployment_ids | The identifier for the deployment attached to stage resource. | deployment_id |
| descriptions | The description for the stage resource. | description |
| created_dates | The date and time that the stage resource was created. | created_date |
