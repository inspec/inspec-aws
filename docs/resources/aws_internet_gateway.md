# aws\_internet\_gateway

Use the `aws_internet_gateway` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a single AWS internet gateway.

## Syntax

An `aws_internet_gateway` resource block declares the tests for a single AWS internet gateway by id or name.

    describe aws_internet_gateway(id: 'igw-abc0123456789deff') do
      it { should exist }
    end 

    describe aws_internet_gateway(name: 'my-igw') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Parameters

Either the id or the name must be provided.

##### id _(required if `name` not provided)_

The value of the `internet_gateway_id` assigned by the AWS after the resource has been created.
This should be in the format of `igw-` followed by 8 or 17 hexadecimal characters and passed as an `id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

##### name _(required if `id` not provided)_

If a `Name` tag is applied to the internet gateway, this can be used to lookup the resource.
This must be passed as a `name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.
If there are multiple internet gateways with the same name, this resource will raise an error.
