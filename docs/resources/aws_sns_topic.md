# aws\_sns\_topic

Use the `aws_sns_topic` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS Simple Notification Service Topic.  SNS topics are channels for related events. AWS resources place events in the SNS topic, while other AWS resources subscribe to receive notifications when new events occur.

## Syntax

    describe aws_sns_topic('arn:aws:sns:*::my-topic-name') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # You may also use has syntax to pass the ARN
    describe aws_sns_topic(arn: 'arn:aws:sns:*::my-topic-name') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Parameters

##### arn _(required)_

This resource accepts a single parameter, the ARN of the SNS Topic. 
This can be passed either as a string or as a `arn: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

See also the [AWS documentation on SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-getting-started.html).

      it { should exist }
    end
