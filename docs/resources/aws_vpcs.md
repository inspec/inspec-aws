# aws\_vpcs

Use the `aws_vpcs` InSpec audit resource to test properties of some or all AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).

Each VPC is uniquely identified by its VPC ID. In addition, each VPC has a non-unique CIDR IP Address range (such as 10.0.0.0/16) which it manages.

Every AWS account has at least one VPC, the "default" VPC, in every region.

## Syntax

An `aws_vpcs` resource block uses an optional filter to select a group of VPCs and then tests that group.

    # Since you always have at least one VPC, this will always pass.
    describe aws_vpcs do
      it { should exist }
    end
    
#### Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

See also the [AWS documentation on VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html).

## Properties

|Property           | Description|
| ---               | --- |
|cidr\_blocks       | The cidr\_blocks property provides a list of the CIDR blocks that the matched VPCs serve as strings. |
|dhcp\_options\_ids | The dhcp\_option\_set\_ids property provides a de-duplicated list of the DHCP Option Set IDs that the matched VPCs use when assigning IPs to resources. |
|vpc\_ids           | The vpc\_ids property provides a list of the IDs of the matched VPCs. |
|tags               | A hash of key-value pairs corresponding to the tags associated with the entity. |
|entries            | Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes. |

## Examples

##### Ensure all VPCs use the same DHCP option set.
    describe aws_vpcs.where { dhcp_options_id != 'dopt-12345678' } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end


##### Check for a Particular VPC ID
    describe aws_vpcs do
      its('vpc_ids') { should include 'vpc-12345678' }
    end

##### Use the VPC IDs to Get a List of Default Security Groups
    aws_vpcs.vpc_ids.each do |vpc_id|
      describe aws_security_group(vpc_id: vpc_id, group_name: 'default') do
        it { should_not allow_in(port: 22) }
      end
    end

##### We shun the 10.0.0.0/8 space
    describe aws_vpcs.where { cidr_block.start_with?('10') } do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

#### Check tags    
    describe aws_vpc do
      its('tags') { should include(:Environment => 'env-name',
                                   :Name => 'vpc-name')}
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_vpcs do
      it { should exist }
    end
      
    describe aws_vpcs.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `ec2:DescribeVpcs` action with Effect set to Allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazonec2.html).
