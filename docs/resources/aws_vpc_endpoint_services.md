# aws\_vpc\_endpoint\_services

Use the `aws_vpc_endpoint_services` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of all AWS VPC Endpoint Services.
To audit a single endpoint service, use the `aws_vpc_endpoint_service` (singular) resource.

## Syntax

An `aws_vpc_endpoint_services` resource block collects a group of VPC endpoint services' descriptions and tests the group.

    describe aws_vpc_endpoint_services
      it { should exist }
    end

## Examples

### Ensure that exactly three VPC endpoint services exist

    describe aws_vpc_endpoint_services do
      its('count') { should eq 3 }
    end

### Filter all services in `us-east-2a` availability_zones

    describe aws_vpc_endpoint_services.where{ availability_zones.include?('us-east-2a') } do
        it { should exist }
    end

### Filter all service where acceptance is required from the service owner

    describe aws_vpc_endpoint_services.where(acceptance_required: true) do
        it { should exist }
    end

### Filter all static if it manages its vpc endpoints

    describe aws_vpc_endpoint_services.where(manages_vpc_endpoints: true) do
        it { should exist }
    end

### Filter all private dns name verification states

    describe aws_vpc_endpoint_services.where(private_dns_name_verification_states: 'verified') do
        it { should exist }
    end

### Request all the service names and check if endpoint policies are supported.

    aws_vpc_endpoint_services.service_names.each do |service_name|
      describe aws_vpc_endpoint_service(service_name: service_name) do
        it { should be_vpc_endpoint_policy_supported }
      end
    end

## Matchers

For the complete list of available matchers, visit [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the 'describe' method returns at least one result.

    describe aws_vpc_endpoint_services.where( PROPERTY: VALUE) do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test an entity that should not exist.

    describe aws_vpc_endpoint_services.where( PROPERTY: VALUE) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal), will need the `EC2:Client:DescribeVpcEndpointServicesResult` action with `Effect` set to `Allow`.
