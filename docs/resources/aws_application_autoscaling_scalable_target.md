# aws\_application\_autoscaling\_scalable\_target

Use the `aws_application_autoscaling_scalable_target` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale.

## Syntax

    describe aws_application_autoscaling_scalable_target( service_namespace: 'SERVICE_NAMESPACE' ) do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

`service_namespace` _(required)_

The namespace of the AWS service that provides the resource.

For additional information, see the [AWS ApplicationAutoScaling ScalableTarget documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-applicationautoscaling-scalabletarget.html).

## Properties

| Property | Description|
| --- | --- |
| service_namespace | The namespace of the AWS service that provides the resource. |
| resource_id | The identifier of the resource associated with the scalable target. |
| scalable_dimension | The scalable dimension associated with the scalable target. |
| min_capacity | The minimum value to scale to in response to a scale-in activity. |
| max_capacity | The maximum value to scale to in response to a scale-out activity. |
| role_arn | The ARN of an IAM role that allows Application Auto Scaling to modify the scalable target on your behalf. |
| creation_time | The Unix timestamp for when the scalable target was created. |
| suspended_state (dynamic_scaling_in_suspended) | Whether scale in by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling policy is suspended. Set the value to `true` if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to remove capacity when a scaling policy is triggered. The default is `false`. |
| suspended_state (dynamic_scaling_out_suspended) | Whether scale out by a target tracking scaling policy or a step scaling policy is suspended. Set the value to `true` if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to add capacity when a scaling policy is triggered. The default is `false`. |
| suspended_state (scheduled_scaling_suspended) | Whether scheduled scaling is suspended. Set the value to `true` if you don't want Application Auto Scaling to add or remove capacity by initiating scheduled actions. The default is `false`. |

## Examples

### Ensure a service namespace is available.

    describe aws_application_autoscaling_scalable_target( service_namespace: 'SERVICE_NAMESPACE' ) do
      its('service_namespace') { should eq 'ec2' }
    end

### Verify the min scale capacity.

    describe aws_application_autoscaling_scalable_target( service_namespace: 'SERVICE_NAMESPACE' ) do
        its('min_capacity') { should eq 1 }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_application_autoscaling_scalable_target( service_namespace: 'SERVICE_NAMESPACE' ) do
      it { should exist }
    end

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the work_group name is available.

    describe aws_application_autoscaling_scalable_target( service_namespace: 'SERVICE_NAMESPACE' ) do
      it { should be_available }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `applicationscaling:client:describe_scalable_targets` action with `Effect` set to `Allow`.
