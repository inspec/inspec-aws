# aws\_ebs\_volume

Use the `aws_ebs_volume` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a single AWS EBS volume.

## Syntax

Ensure an EBS exists

    describe aws_ebs_volume('VOLUME_NAME') do
      it { should exist }
    end

You may also use hash syntax to pass the EBS volume name.

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'VOLUME_NAME') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

This resource accepts a single parameter, either the EBS volume name or ID. _mandatory_

`volume_id` _(required if `name` not provided)_

The EBS volume ID which uniquely identifies the volume. This can be passed as either a string or an `volume_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

`name` _(required if `volume_id` not provided)_

The EBS volume name which uniquely identifies the volume. This must be passed as a `name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

See also the [AWS documentation on EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html).

## Examples

### Test that an EBS Volume does not exist

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'VOLUME_NAME') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### Test that an EBS Volume is encrypted

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'VOLUME_NAME') do
      it { should be_encrypted }
    end

### Test that an EBS Volume has the correct size

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'VOLUME_NAME') do
      its('size') { should cmp 32 }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

#### Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'VOLUME_NAME') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'VOLUME_NAME') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

#### be_encrypted

The `be_encrypted` matcher tests if the described EBS volume is encrypted.
    
    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'VOLUME_NAME') do
        it { should be_encrypted }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `EC2:Client:DescribeVolumesResult` actions set to `allow`.
