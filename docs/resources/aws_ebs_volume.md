# aws\_ebs\_volume

Use the `aws_ebs_volume` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS EBS volume.

## Syntax

Ensure an EBS exists

    describe aws_ebs_volume('vol-01a2349e94458a507') do
      it { should exist }
    end
You may also use hash syntax to pass the EBS volume name

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'data-vol') do
      it { should exist }
    end
    
#### Parameters
This resource accepts a single parameter, either the EBS Volume name or id. At least one must be provided.

##### volume\_id _(required if `name` not provided)_

The EBS Volume ID which uniquely identifies the volume.
This can be passed as either a string or an `volume_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

##### name _(required if `volume_id` not provided)_

The EBS Volume Name which uniquely identifies the volume.
This must be passed as a `name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

      it { should_not exist }
    end

##### Test that an EBS Volume is encrypted
    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'secure_data_vol') do
      it { should be_encrypted }
    end

##### Test that an EBS Volume the correct size
    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'data_vol') do
      its('size') { should cmp 32 }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'data_vol') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_ebs_volume(name: 'data_vol') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

#### be\_encrypted

The `be_encrypted` matcher tests if the described EBS Volume is encrypted.

    it { should be_encrypted }
