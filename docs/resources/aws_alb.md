# aws\_alb

Use the `aws_alb` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB).

## Syntax

Ensure that an `aws_alb` exists

    describe aws_alb('arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_alb(load_balancer_arn: 'arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing') do
      it { should exist }
    end
    
#### Parameters

##### load\_balancer\_arn _(required)_

This resource accepts a single parameter, the ALB Arn which uniquely identifies the ALB. 
This can be passed either as a string or as a `load_balancer_arn: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

See also the [AWS documentation on Elastic Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/APIReference).

      its('zone_names')        { should include 'us-east-2a' }

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has no special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_alb('AnExistingALB') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_alb('ANonExistentALB') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `elasticloadbalancing:DescribeLoadBalancers` action set to Allow.
