# aws\_ebs\_volumes

Use the `aws_ebs_volumes` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a collection of AWS EBS volumes.

EBS volumes are persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud.

## Syntax

 Ensure you have exactly 3 volumes

    describe aws_ebs_volumes do
      its('volume_ids.count') { should cmp 3 }
    end
    
#### Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

See also the [AWS documentation on EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html).

## Properties

|Property                    | Description|
| ---                        | --- |
|volume\_ids                 | The unique IDs of the EBS Volumes returned. |
|entries                     | Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes. |
   
## Examples

#####Ensure a specific volume exists
    describe aws_ebs_volumes do
      its('volume_ids') { should include 'vol-12345678' }
    end

##### Use the InSpec resource to request the IDs of all EBS volumes, then test in-depth using `aws_ebs_volume` to ensure all volumes are encrypted and have a sensible size.

    aws_ebs_volumes.volume_ids.each do |volume_id|
      describe aws_ebs_volume(volume_id) do
        it          { should be_encrypted }
        its('size') { should be > 10 }
        its('iops') { should cmp 100 }
      end
    end


## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/). 

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_ebs_volumes do
      it { should exist }
    end
      
    describe aws_ebs_volumes do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `ec2:DescribeVolumes`, and `iam:GetInstanceProfile` actions set to allow.
