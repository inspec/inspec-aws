      it { should exist }
      its('visibility_timeout') { should be 300 }
    end

#### Ensure maximum message size is set
    describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
        its('maximum_message_size') { should be 262144 } # 256 KB      
    end

##### Test the delay time 
    describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
        its('delay_seconds') { should be 0 }

##### Ensure messages are retained for 4 days
    describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
        its('message_retention_period') { should be 345600 } # 4 days
    end

##### Check if queue is fifo
    describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
        its('is_fifo_queue') { should be false }
    end
