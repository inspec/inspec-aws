    describe aws_iam_groups('mygroup') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Hash syntax for group name
    describe aws_iam_groups(group_name: 'mygroup') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

      its('group_names') { should include 'prod-access-group' }
    end

##### Ensure there are no groups with inline policies.

      its('group_names') { should be_empty }
    end
