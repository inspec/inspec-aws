# aws\_nat\_gateways

Use the `aws_nat_gateways` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of all AWS NAT gateways owned by the AWS account.

## Syntax

An `aws_nat_gateways` resource block collects all of the NAT gateways and then tests that group.

    describe aws_nat_gateways do
      it { should exist }
    end 

#### Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

## Properties

|Property            | Description |
| ---                | --- |
|ids                 | The ID of the NAT gateway. The field name is `id`.|
|names               | The value of the `Name` tag. It is `nil` if not defined. The field name is `name`.|
|vpc\_ids            | The ID of the VPC in which the NAT gateway is located. The field name is `vpc_id`.|
|subnet\_ids         | The ID of the subnet in which the NAT gateway is placed. The field name is `subnet_id`.|
|tags                | A hash, with each key-value pair corresponding to a NAT gateway tag. The field name is `tags`.|
|states              | The sate of the NAT gateway. Valid values are: `pending`, `failed`, `available`, `deleting` and `deleted`. The field name is `state`.|


## Examples

##### Test that there are exactly 3 NAT gateways

    describe aws_nat_gateways do
      its('count') { should cmp 3 }
    end
    
    
##### Use this InSpec resource to request the ids of all NAT gateways, then test in-depth using `aws_nat_gateway` InSpec singular AWS resource.

    aws_nat_gateways.ids.each do |id|
      describe aws_nat_gateway(id: id) do
        its('state') { should eq 'available' }
      end
    end

## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/). 

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.
The field names described in the [properties table](##-properties) should be used for the `<property>` in the `where` clause.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_nat_gateways.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should exist }
    end
      
    describe aws_nat_gateways.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end
