# aws\_route53resolver\_resolver\_rule\_association

The Resolver rule association determines which DNS queries that originate in the VPC are forwarded to your network.

## Syntax

Ensure that a resolver rule exists.

    describe aws_route53resolver_resolver_rule_association(resolver_rule_association_id: 'RESOLVER_RULE_ASSOCIATION_ID') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

`resolver_rule_association_id` _(required)_

The ID of the Resolver rule association that you want to get information about.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on AWS Route53Resolver Resolver Rule Association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-route53resolver-resolverruleassociation.html).

    end

The controls will pass if the `get` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_route53resolver_resolver_rule_association(resolver_rule_association_id: 'RESOLVER_RULE_ASSOCIATION_ID') do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.
      
    describe aws_route53resolver_resolver_rule_association(resolver_rule_association_id: 'RESOLVER_RULE_ASSOCIATION_ID') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the entity is available.

    describe aws_route53resolver_resolver_rule_association(resolver_rule_association_id: 'RESOLVER_RULE_ASSOCIATION_ID') do
      it { should be_available }
    end

## AWS Permissions
