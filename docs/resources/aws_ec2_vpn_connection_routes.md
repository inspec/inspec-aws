# aws_ec2_vpn_connection_routes

Use the `aws_ec2_vpn_connection_routes` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS EC2 VPN connection routes.

The `AWS::EC2::VPNConnectionRoute` resource specifies a static route for a VPN connection between an existing virtual private gateway and a VPN customer gateway. The static route allows traffic to be routed from the virtual private gateway to the VPN customer gateway.

## Syntax

Ensure that VPN Connection ID exists.

    describe aws_ec2_vpn_connection_routes(vpn_connection_id: 'VPN_CONNECTION_ID') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

`vpn_connection_id` _(required)_

The ID of the VPN Connection.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on AWS EC2 VPN Connection Route.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpn-connection-route.html).

## Properties

| Property | Description | Field |
| :---: | :--- | :---: |
| destination_cidr_blocks | The CIDR block associated with the local subnet of the customer data center. | destination_cidr_block |
| sources | Indicates how the routes were provided. | source |
| states | The current state of the static route. | state |

## Examples

### Ensure a destination CIDR block is available.

    describe aws_ec2_vpn_connection_routes(vpn_connection_id: 'VPN_CONNECTION_ID') do
      its('destination_cidr_blocks') { should eq [['CIDR_BLOCK']] }
    end

### Ensure that a VPN connection route is `available`.

    describe aws_ec2_vpn_connection_routes(vpn_connection_id: 'VPN_CONNECTION_ID') do
        its('states') { should eq [['available']] }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_ec2_vpn_connection_routes(vpn_connection_id: 'VPN_CONNECTION_ID') do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

    describe aws_ec2_vpn_connection_routes(vpn_connection_id: 'VPN_CONNECTION_ID') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `EC2:Client:DescribeVpnConnectionsResult` action with `Effect` set to `Allow`.
