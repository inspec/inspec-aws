# aws\_s3\_bucket

Use the `aws_s3_bucket` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS bucket.

## Syntax

An `aws_s3_bucket` resource block declares a bucket by name, and then lists tests to be performed.

    describe aws_s3_bucket(bucket_name: 'test_bucket') do
      it { should exist }
      it { should_not be_public }
    end

    describe aws_s3_bucket('test_bucket') do
      it { should exist }
    end
    
#### Parameters

##### bucket\_name _(required)_

This resource accepts a single parameter, the S3 Bucket Name which uniquely identifies the bucket. 
This can be passed either as a string or as a `bucket_name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

See also the [AWS documentation on S3 Buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html).

## Properties

|Property      | Description|
| ---          | --- |
|region        | The region of the bucket. Region is overridden based on the location returned from S3 |
|bucket\_acl    | An array of AWS Grants detailing permission grants on the bucket. |
|bucket\_policy | The IAM policy document controlling access to the bucket.  |
|bucket\_lifecycle\_rules | The lifecycle policy rules that define actions S3 will take for all objects (or a subset of objects) in their lifetime. |
|tags          | An hash with each key-value pair corresponding to a tag associated with the entity |

## Examples


##### Test the bucket-level ACL
    describe aws_s3_bucket('test_bucket') do
      its('bucket_acl.count') { should eq 1 }
    end

##### Check if a bucket has a bucket policy
    describe aws_s3_bucket('test_bucket') do
      its('bucket_policy') { should be_empty }
    end

##### Check if a bucket appears to be exposed to the public
    describe aws_s3_bucket('test_bucket') do
      it { should_not be_public }
    end

##### Check if the correct region is set
    describe aws_s3_bucket('test_bucket') do
      its('region') { should eq 'us-east-1' }
    end
    
##### Check bucket's ACL for correct grants
    bucket_acl = aws_s3_bucket('my-bucket').bucket_acl

    # Look for grants to "AllUsers" (that is, the public)
    all_users_grants = bucket_acl.select do |g|
      g.grantee.type == 'Group' && g.grantee.uri =~ /AllUsers/
    end

    # Look for grants to "AuthenticatedUsers" (that is, any authenticated AWS user - nearly public)
    auth_grants = bucket_acl.select do |g|
      g.grantee.type == 'Group' && g.grantee.uri =~ /AuthenticatedUsers/
    end
    
##### Test all buckets    
      aws_s3_buckets.bucket_names.each do |bucket_name|
          describe aws_s3_bucket(bucket_name) do
            it { should have_default_encryption_enabled }
            end
        end
    
##### Test buckets in a specific region    
      aws_s3_buckets.bucket_names.each do |bucket_name|
        if aws_s3_bucket(bucket_name: bucket_name).region == region
          describe aws_s3_bucket(bucket_name) do
            it { should have_default_encryption_enabled }
                end
            end
        end

##### Check if a bucket has a bucket policy that requires requests to use HTTPS
      describe aws_s3_bucket('test_bucket') do
        it { should have_secure_transport_enabled }
      end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

#### be\_public

The `be_public` matcher tests if the bucket has potentially insecure access controls. This high-level matcher detects several insecure conditions, which may be enhanced in the future. Currently, the matcher reports an insecure bucket if any of the following conditions are met:

  1. A bucket ACL grant exists for the 'AllUsers' group
  2. A bucket ACL grant exists for the 'AuthenticatedUsers' group
  3. A bucket policy has an effect 'Allow' and principal '*'

Note: This resource does not detect insecure object ACLs.

    it { should_not be_public }

#### have\_access\_logging\_enabled

The `have_access_logging_enabled` matcher tests if access logging is enabled for the s3 bucket.

    it { should have_access_logging_enabled }

#### have\_default\_encryption\_enabled

The `have_default_encryption_enabled` matcher tests if default encryption is enabled for the s3 bucket.

    it { should have_default_encryption_enabled }

#### have\_versioning\_enabled

The `have_versioning_enabled` matcher tests if versioning is enabled for the s3 bucket.

   it { should have_versioning_enabled }

#### have\_secure\_transport\_enabled

The `have_secure_transport_enabled` matcher tests if a bucket policy that explicitly denies requests via HTTP is enabled for the s3 bucket.

   it { should have_secure_transport_enabled }

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `s3:GetBucketAcl`, `s3:GetBucketLocation`, `s3:GetBucketLogging`, `s3:GetBucketPolicy`, and `s3:GetEncryptionConfiguration` actions set to allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_amazons3.html).
