# aws_ec2_network_interfaces

Use the `aws_ec2_network_interfaces` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple network interfaces in an Amazon EC2 instance for AWS CloudFormation.

The `AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface` resource describes a network interface in an Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance for AWS CloudFormation.

## Syntax

Ensure that network interface ID exists.

    describe aws_ec2_network_interfaces do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on AWS EC2 network interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-network-interface.html).

## Examples

### Ensure a network interface ID is available.

    describe aws_ec2_network_interfaces do
      its('network_interface_ids') { should include 'NetworkInterfaceId' }
    end

### Ensure that an availability zone is available.

    describe aws_ec2_network_interfaces do
        its('availability_zones') { should include "us-east-2a" }
    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_ec2_network_interfaces do
      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

    describe aws_ec2_network_interfaces do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `EC2:Client:DescribeNetworkInterfacesResult` action with `Effect` set to `Allow`.
