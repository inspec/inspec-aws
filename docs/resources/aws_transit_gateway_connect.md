    end

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

    describe aws_transit_gateway_connect(transit_gateway_attachment_id: 'TRANSIT_GATEWAY_CONNECT_ATTACHMENT_ID') do
      it { should exits }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

    describe aws_transit_gateway_connect(transit_gateway_attachment_id: 'TRANSIT_GATEWAY_CONNECT_ATTACHMENT_ID') do
      it { should_not exits }
    end

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the entity is available.

    describe aws_transit_gateway_connect(transit_gateway_attachment_id: 'dummy') do
      it { should be_available }
    end
