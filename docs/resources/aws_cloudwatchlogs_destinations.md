# aws_cloudwatchlogs_destinations

Use the `aws_cloudwatchlogs_destinations` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS Logs destinations.

The `AWS::Logs::Destination` resource type specifies a CloudWatch Logs destination. A destination encapsulates a physical resource (such as an Amazon Kinesis data stream) and enables you to subscribe that resource to a stream of log events.

## Syntax

Ensure that the destination name exists.

    describe aws_cloudwatchlogs_destinations do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on AWS::Logs::Destination.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-destination.html).
