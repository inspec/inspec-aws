# aws\_internet\_gateways

Use the `aws_internet_gateways` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of all AWS internet gateways owned by the AWS account.

## Syntax

An `aws_internet_gateways` resource block collects all of the internet gateways and then tests that group.

    describe aws_internet_gateways do
      it { should exist }
    end 

#### Parameters

This resource does not expect any parameters.

      its('count') { should cmp 3 }
    end
    
##### Use this InSpec resource to request the ids of all internet gateways, then test in-depth using `aws_internet_gateway`.

    aws_internet_gateways.ids.each do |id|
      describe aws_internet_gateway(id: id) do
        it { should be_attached }

#### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.
The field names described in the [properties table](##-properties) should be used for the `<property>` in the `where` clause.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

    describe aws_internet_gateways.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should exist }
    end
      
    describe aws_internet_gateways.where( <property>: <value>) do
      it { should_not exist }
    end
