# aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarms

Use the `aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarms` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS CloudWatch composite alarms.

The `AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm` resource type creates or updates a composite alarm. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.

## Syntax

Ensure that the alarms exists.

    describe aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarms do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

This resource does not require any required parameters.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on AWS CloudWatch composite alarm.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudwatch-compositealarm.html).
