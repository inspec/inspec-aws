# aws\_cloudtrail\_trail

Use the `aws_cloudtrail_trail` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS CloudTrail.

## Syntax

An `aws_cloudtrail_trail` resource block identifies a trail by `trail_name`.

    # Find a trail by name
    describe aws_cloudtrail_trail('trail-name') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Hash syntax for trail name
    describe aws_cloudtrail_trail(trail_name: 'trail-name') do
      it { should exist }
    end

#### Parameters

##### trail\_name _(required)_
This resource expects a single parameter, the CloudTrail Name which uniquely identifies it. 
This can be passed either as a string or as a `trail_name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.
