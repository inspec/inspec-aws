# aws_ec2_eip_association

Use the `aws_ec2_eip_association` InSpec audit resource to test properties of the singular resource of AWS Elastic IP association.

An Elastic IP (EIP) is uniquely identified by the public IPv4 address, for example `association_id`.

## Syntax

##### Verify that the association exists.

    describe aws_ec2_eip_association(association_id: 'ASSOCIATION_ID') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Parameters

`association_id` _(required)_

The association ID for the address.

See the [AWS documentation on AWS Elastic IP association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-eip-association.html) for additional information.

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| association_id | The association ID for the address. |

## Examples

##### Check association ID whether it is correct or not

    describe aws_ec2_eip_association(association_id: 'ASSOCIATION_ID') do
       its('ASSOCIATION_ID') { should eq "ASSOCIATION_ID" }
    end

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

      it { should exist }
    end

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

    describe aws_ec2_eip_association(association_id: 'ASSOCIATION_ID') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### be_available

Check if the entity is available.

    describe aws_ec2_eip_association(association_id: 'ASSOCIATION_ID') do
      it { should be_available }
    end
