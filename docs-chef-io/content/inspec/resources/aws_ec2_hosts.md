## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

```ruby
describe aws_ec2_hosts do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_ec2_hosts do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

Use `should` to check if the entity is available.

```ruby
describe aws_ec2_hosts do
  it { should be_available }
end
```
