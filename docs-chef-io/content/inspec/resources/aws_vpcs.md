Use the `aws_vpcs` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of some or all AWS Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and the CIDR block that is used within the VPC.

Each VPC is uniquely identified by its `VPC ID`. In addition, each VPC has a non-unique CIDR IP address range (such as 10.0.0.0/16), which it manages.

Every AWS account has at least one VPC, the "default" VPC, in every region.

This resource also have the functionality to test the CIDR block. The VPCCidrBlock associates a CIDR block with your VPC. You can only associate a single IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC. The IPv6 CIDR block size is fixed at /56.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html).
See the [AWS documentation on VPCCidrBlock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpccidrblock.html).

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

An `aws_vpcs` resource block uses an optional filter to select a group of VPCs and then tests that group.

    # Since you always have at least one VPC, this will always pass.
```ruby
describe aws_vpcs do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

This resource does not require any parameters.

`cidr_block_association_ids`
: List of all the association ID of the IPv4 CIDR blocks.

: **Field**: `cidr_block_association_ids`

`associated_cidr_blocks`
: List of all the associated CIDR blocks.

: **Field**: `associated_cidr_blocks`

`cidr_block_states`
: List of all the states of the CIDR blocks.

: **Field**: `cidr_block_states`

`ipv6_cidr_block_association_ids`
: List of all the association ID of the IPv6 CIDR blocks.

: **Field**: `ipv6_cidr_block_association_ids`

`ipv6_cidr_blocks`
: List of all the associated IPV6 CIDR blocks.

`ipv6_cidr_block_states`
: List of all the states of the IPV6 CIDR blocks.

: **Field**: `ipv6_cidr_block_states`

`ipv6_network_border_groups`
: List of all the network border group options.

: **Field**: `ipv6_network_border_groups`

`ipv6_pools`
: List of all IDs of the IPv6 address pool from which the IPv6 CIDR block is allocated.

: **Field**: `ipv6_pools`

`entries`
: Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes.

: **Field**: Not Applicable

## Examples

**Ensure all VPCs use the same DHCP option set.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs.where { dhcp_options_id != 'DOPT-12345678' } do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

**Check for a Particular VPC ID.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs do
  its('vpc_ids') { should include 'VPC-12345678' }
end
```

**Use the VPC IDs to get a list of Default Security Groups.**

```ruby
aws_vpcs.vpc_ids.each do |vpc_id|
  describe aws_security_group(vpc_id: vpc_id, group_name: 'DEFAULT') do
    it { should_not allow_in(port: 22) }
  end
end
```

**We shun the `10.0.0.0/8` space.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs.where { cidr_block.start_with?('10') } do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

**Check tags.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpc do
  its('tags') { should include(:Environment => 'ENV-NAME',
                               :Name => 'VPC-NAME')}
end
```

**Ensure AWS VPC IPV6 CIDR Block plural resource has the correct properties.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs.where { ipv6_cidr_blocks.include?('2600:1F16:409:6700::/56') } do
    it { should exist }
end
```

**Ensure AWS VPC CIDR BLOCK failed associations are not fetched.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs.where { cidr_block_states.reject?('FAILED') } do
    it { should exist }
end
```

**Ensure AWS VPC CIDR Block plural resource has the associated id.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs do
    its ('CIDR_BLOCK_ASSOCIATION_IDS') { should include "VPC-CIDR-ASSOC-0123456789" }
end
```

**Ensure AWS VPC IPv6 CIDR Block plural resource has the associated id.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs do
    its ('IPV6_CIDR_BLOCK_ASSOCIATION_IDS') { should include "VPC-CIDR-ASSOC-0123456789" }
end
```

**Ensure AWS VPC CIDR BLOCK disassociated associations are fetched.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs.where { ipv6_cidr_block_states.select?('DISASSOCIATED') } do
    it { should exist }
end
```

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a complete list of the available matchers, visit [Universal Matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exist

The control will pass if the `describe` returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs do
  it { should exist }
end
```

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs.where( <property> : <value>) do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### include

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs do
  its ('IPV_6_CIDR_ASSOCIATION_IDS')  { should include "VPC-CIDR-ASSOC-0123456789" }
  its ('IPV_6_CIDR_STATES') { should include "ASSOCIATED" }
  its ('IPV_6_CIDR_NETWORK_BORDER_GROUPS')  { should include "US-EAST-2" }
  its ('IPV_6_CIDR_IPV_6_POOLS')  { should include "AMAZON" }
end
```

### be_empty

```ruby
describe aws_vpcs do
  its ('IPV_6_CIDR_STATUS_MESSAGES')  { should be_empty }
