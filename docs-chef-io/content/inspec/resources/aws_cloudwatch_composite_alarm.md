Use the `aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single specific AWS CloudWatch composite alarm.

The `AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm` resource type creates or updates a composite alarm. When you create a composite alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into account the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of the rule are met.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on AWS CloudWatch composite alarm.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudwatch-compositealarm.html).

## Examples

**Ensure an actions is enabled.**

```ruby
describe aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm(alarm_name: 'COMPOSITE_ALARM_NAME') do
  its('actions_enabled') { should eq true }
end
```

**Ensure an alarm ARN is available.**

```ruby
describe aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm(alarm_name: 'COMPOSITE_ALARM_NAME') do
    its('alarm_arn') { should eq 'ALARM_ARN' }
end
```

**Ensure an alarm name is available.**

```ruby
describe aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm(alarm_name: 'COMPOSITE_ALARM_NAME') do
    its('alarm_name') { should eq 'ALARM_NAME' }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

```ruby
describe aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm(alarm_name: 'COMPOSITE_ALARM_NAME') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test that an entity does not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm(alarm_name: 'COMPOSITE_ALARM_NAME') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the entity is available.

```ruby
describe aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm(alarm_name: 'COMPOSITE_ALARM_NAME') do
  it { should be_available }
end
```
