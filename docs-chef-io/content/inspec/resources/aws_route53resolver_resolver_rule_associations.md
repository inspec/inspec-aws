Use the `aws_route53resolver_resolver_rule_associations` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS Route53 Resolver rule associations.

The Resolver rule association determines which DNS queries that originate in the VPC are forwarded to your network.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on AWS Route53Resolver Resolver Rule Association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-route53resolver-resolverruleassociation.html).
