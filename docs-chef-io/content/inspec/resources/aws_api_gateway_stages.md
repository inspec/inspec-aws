Use the `aws_api_gateway_stages` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS API Gateway stages.

The 'AWS::ApiGateway::Stage' resource deploys an API Gateway REST API resource to a stage so that clients can call the API over the internet. The stage acts as an environment.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS API Gateway stage Stage documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-stage.html).
