Use the `aws_vpc` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a single AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the CIDR Block that is used within the VPC.

Each VPC is uniquely identified by its ID. In addition, each VPC has a non-unique CIDR IP address range (such as 10.0.0.0/16), which it manages.

Every AWS account has at least one VPC, the "default" VPC, in every region.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html).

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

An `aws_vpc` resource block identifies a VPC by ID. If no VPC ID is provided, the default VPC is used.

    # Find the default VPC
```ruby
describe aws_vpc do
  it { should exist }
end
```

    # Find a VPC by ID
```ruby
describe aws_vpc('VPC-12345678987654321') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

    # Hash syntax for ID
```ruby
describe aws_vpc(vpc_id: 'VPC-12345678') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

If no parameter is provided, the subscription's default VPC will be returned.

`vpc_id` _(optional)_

: This resource accepts a single parameter, the VPC ID.
  This can be passed either as a string or as a `vpc_id: 'VALUE'` key-value entry in a hash.

## Properties

`cidr_block`
: The IPv4 address range that is managed by the VPC.

`dhcp_options_id`
: The ID of the set of DHCP options associated with the VPC (or `default` if the default options are associated with the VPC).

`instance_tenancy`
: The allowed tenancy of the instances launched into the VPC.

`state`
: The state of the VPC. Valid values: `pending` and `available`.

`vpc_id`
: The ID of the VPC.

`tags`
: The tags of the VPC.

`associated_cidr_blocks`
: The associated CIDR blocks.

`disassociated_cidr_blocks`
: The CIDR blocks that are disassociated.

`failed_cidr_blocks`
: The failed CIDR block associations.

`associating_cidr_blocks`
: The CIDR block associations that are yet in the pending stage.

`disassociating`
: The CIDR block associations that are yet in the disassociating stage.

`failing`
: The CIDR block associations that are yet in failing stage.

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

**Test the CIDR Block of a named VPC.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpc('VPC-87654321') do
  its('cidr_block') { should cmp '10.0.0.0/16' }
end
```

**Test the state of the VPC.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpc do
  its ('STATE') { should eq 'AVAILABLE' }
**or equivalently.**

  it { should be_available }
end
```

**Test the allowed tenancy of instances launched into the VPC.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpc do
  its ('INSTANCE_TENANCY') { should eq 'DEFAULT' }
  it { should be_default_instance }
  it { should_not be_dedicated_instance }
  it { should_not be_host_instance }
end
```

**Test tags on the VPC.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpc do
  its('TAGS') { should include(:Environment => 'ENV-NAME',
                               :Name => 'VPC-NAME')}
end
```

**Test if the IPV6 CIDR Block is associated to a named VPC.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpc do
  it { should have_ipv6_cidr_block_associated?(aws_ipv_6_cidr_block_association_set_ipv_6_cidr_block) }
end
```

**Test if the CIDR Block is associated to a named VPC.**

```ruby
describe aws_vpc do
  it { should have_cidr_block_associated?(aws_cidr_block) }
end
```
