Use the `aws_api_gateway_usage_plan` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a single specific AWS API Gateway usage plan. A usage plan sets a target for the throttling and quota limits on individual client API keys.

For additional information, including parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on AWS APIGateway UsagePlan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-usageplan.html).

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

Ensure that a usage plan exists.

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

`usage_plan_id` _(required)_
: The identifier of a usage plan resource.

## Properties

`id`
: The identifier of a usage plan resource.

: **Field**: `id`

`name`
: The name of a usage plan.

: **Field**: `name`

`description`
: The description of a usage plan.

: **Field**: `description`

`api_stages`
: The associated API stages of a usage plan.

: **Field**: `api_stages`

`api_stages_api_ids`
: API ID of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

: **Field**: `api_stages[0].api_id`

`api_stages_stages`
: API stage name of the associated API stage in a usage plan.

: **Field**: `api_stages[0].stage`

`api_stages_throttles`
: Map containing method level throttling information for API stage in a usage plan.

: **Field**: `api_stages[0].throttle`

`throttle`
: The overall request rate (average requests per second) and burst capacity. A map containing method level throttling information for the API stage in a usage plan.

: **Field**: `throttle`

`throttle.burst_limit`
: The API target request burst rate limit. This allows more requests for a period of time than the target rate limit.

: **Field**: `throttle.burst_limit`

`throttle.rate_limit`
: The API target request rate limit.

: **Field**: `throttle.rate_limit`

`quota`
: The maximum target number of permitted requests that the user can make within a given time interval.

: **Field**: `quota`

`quota.limit`
: The target maximum number of requests that can be made in a given time period.

: **Field**: `quota.limit`

`quota.offset`
: The number of requests subtracted from the given limit in the initial time period.

: **Field**: `quota.offset`

`quota.period`
: The time period in which the limit applies. Valid values are `DAY`, `WEEK`, or `MONTH`.

: **Field**: `quota.period`

`product_code`
: The AWS Markeplace product identifier to associate with the usage plan as a SaaS product on AWS Marketplace.

: **Field**: `product_code`

`tags`
: The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a given resource.

: **Field**: `tags`

## Examples

### Test to ensure a usage plan ID is available

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  its('id') { should eq 'USAGE_PLAN_ID' }
end
```

### Test to ensure a usage plan name is available

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  its('name') { should eq 'USAGE_PLAN_NAME' }
end
```

### Test to verify the quota limit is set to `2` in the usage plan API gateway

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  its('quota.limit') { should eq 2 }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

The control passes if the `get` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test that the entity does not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
