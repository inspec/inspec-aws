Use the `aws_kms_key` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS KMS Key.

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. AWS KMS lets you create master keys that can never be exported from the service and which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data based on policies you define.

Each AWS KMS Key is uniquely identified by its key_id or arn.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on KS Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/getting-started.html).

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

An aws_kms_key resource block identifies a key by key_arn or the key id.

    # Find a kms key by arn
```ruby
describe aws_kms_key('arn:aws:kms:us-east-1::key/4321dcba-21io-23de-85he-ab0987654321') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

    # Find a kms key by just the id
```ruby
describe aws_kms_key('4321dcba-21io-23de-85he-ab0987654321') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

    # Hash syntax for key arn
```ruby
describe aws_kms_key(key_id: 'arn:aws:kms:us-east-1::key/4321dcba-21io-23de-85he-ab0987654321') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

`alias` _(required if `key_id` not specified)_

: This resource accepts searching for a KMS Key by it's Alias.
  This can be passed as a `alias: 'alias/value'` key-value entry in a hash. This will then use the `target_key_id` from the Alias to search for the KMS Key.

`key_id` _(required if `alias` not specified)_

: This resource accepts searching for a KMS Key by the KMS Key ID which can represent both the actual Key ID or the ARN of the Key.
  This can be passed either as a string or as a `key_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

## Properties

`key_id`
: The globally unique identifier for the key.

`arn`
: The ARN identifier of the specified key.

`creation_date`
: Specifies the date and time when the key was created.

`created_days_ago`
: Specifies the number of days since the key was created.

`key_state`
: Specifies the state of the key one of "Enabled", "Disabled", "PendingDeletion", "PendingImport". To just check if the key is enabled or not, use the `be_enabled` matcher.

`description`
: The description of the key.

`deletion_time`
: Specifies the date and time after which AWS KMS deletes the key. This value is present only when KeyState is PendingDeletion, otherwise this value is nil.

`invalidation_time`
: Provides the date and time until the key is not valid.  Once the key is not valid, AWS KMS deletes the key and it becomes unusable.  This value will be null unless the keys Origin is EXTERNAL and its matcher have_key_expiration is set to true.

`tags`
: A hash with each key-value pair corresponding to a tag associated with the entity.

## Examples

**Test that the specified key does exist.**

```ruby
describe aws_kms_key('arn:aws:kms:us-east-1::key/4321dcba-21io-23de-85he-ab0987654321') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

**Test that the specified key is enabled.**

```ruby
describe aws_kms_key('arn:aws:kms:us-east-1::key/4321dcba-21io-23de-85he-ab0987654321') do
  it { should be_enabled }
end
```

**Test that the specified key is rotation enabled.**

```ruby
describe aws_kms_key('arn:aws:kms:us-east-1::key/4321dcba-21io-23de-85he-ab0987654321') do
  it { should have_rotation_enabled }
end
```

**Makes sure that the key was created at least 10 days ago.**

```ruby
describe aws_kms_key('arn:aws:kms:us-east-1::key/4321dcba-21io-23de-85he-ab0987654321') do
  its('creation_date') { should be < Time.now - 10 * 86400 }
end
```

## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following special matchers. For a full list of available matchers (such as `exist`) please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist in all cases.

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.


```ruby
it { should exist }
```

```ruby
it { should_not exist }
```

#### be_enabled

The test will pass if the specified key's key_state is set to enabled.

```ruby
it { should be_enabled }
```

#### be_external
Provides whether the source of the key's key material is external or not.  If it is not external than it was created by AWS KMS.  When it is external, the key material was imported from an existing key management infrastructure or the key lacks key material.

```ruby
it { should be_external }
```

#### be_managed_by_aws

Provides whether or not the key manager is from AWS. If it is not managed by AWS, it is managed by the customer.

```ruby
it { should be_managed_by_aws }
```

#### have_key_expiration

Specifies whether the key's key material expires. This value is null unless the keys Origin is External.

```ruby
it { should have_key_expiration }
```

#### have_rotation_enabled

The test will pass if automatic rotation of the key material is enabled for the specified key.

```ruby
it { should have_rotation_enabled }
```

## AWS Permissions

Your [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/intro-structure.html#intro-structure-principal) will need the `KMS:Client:DescribeKeyResponse`, and `KMS:Client:GetKeyRotationStatusResponse` actions set to allow.

You can find detailed documentation at [Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_awskeymanagementservice.html).
