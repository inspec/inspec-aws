  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

`usage_plan_id` _(required)_

: The usage plan resource ID represents the usage plan containing the to-be-retrieved usage plan's key resource and a plan customer.

## Properties

## Examples

### Test to ensure a usage plan key ID is available

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan_keys(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  its('ids') { should include 'USAGE_PLAN_KEY_ID' }
end
```

### Test to ensure a usage plan key name is available

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan_keys(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  its('names') { should include 'USAGE_PLAN_KEY_NAME' }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

The control passes if the `get` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan_keys(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test that the entity does not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_usage_plan_keys(usage_plan_id: 'USAGE_PLAN_ID') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
