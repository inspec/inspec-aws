## Examples

**Check if an AMI is public.**

```ruby
describe aws_ami(image_id: 'aki-25348fd4323') do
  it { should be_public }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

This resource has the following special matchers.

### be_public

The `be_public` matcher tests if the AMI has public launch permissons.

```ruby
describe aws_ami(image_id: 'aki-1234') do
  it { should be_public }
end
```

```ruby
describe aws_ami(image_id: 'aki-6789') do
  it { should_not be_public }
end
```

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_ami(image_id: 'aki-1234') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

```ruby
describe aws_ami(image_id: 'aki-6789') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
