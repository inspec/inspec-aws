`is_fifo_queue`
: A boolean value indicate if this queue is a FIFO queue.

`visibility_timeout`
: An integer indicating the visibility timeout of the message in seconds.

`maximum_message_size`
: An integer indicating the maximum message size in bytes.

`message_retention_period`
: An integer indicating the maximum retention period for a message in seconds.

`delay_seconds`
: An integer indicating the delay in seconds for the queue.

`receive_message_wait_timeout_seconds`
: An integer indicating the number of seconds an attempt to recieve a message will wait before returning.

`content_based_deduplication`
: A boolean value indicate if content based deduplication is enabled or not.

## Examples

**Ensure that a queue exists and has a visibility timeout of 300 seconds.**

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
  it { should exist }
  its('visibility_timeout') { should be 300 }
end
```

**Ensure maximum message size is set.**

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
**256 KB      .**

end
```

**Test the delay time .**

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
    its('delay_seconds') { should be 0 }
end
```

**Ensure messages are retained for 4 days.**

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
**4 days.**

end
```

**Check if queue is fifo.**

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
    its('is_fifo_queue') { should be false }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

This resource has the following special matchers.

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should` to test the entity should exist.

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueueWhichDoesntExist') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### policy_statement_principal_all_permissions_enabled

The control will pass if at least one Principal has all permissions enabled.

Use `should` to test when a Principal with all permissions should exist.

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
  it { should be_policy_statement_principal_all_permissions_enabled }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test that a Principal with all permissions should not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueueWhichDoesntExist') do
  it { should_not be_policy_statement_principal_all_permissions_enabled }
end
```

### policy_statement_action_all_permissions_enabled

The control will pass if at least one action has all permissions enabled.

Use `should` to test that at least one action has all permissions enabled should exist.

```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueue') do
  it { should be_policy_statement_action_all_permissions_enabled }
end
```ruby
describe aws_sqs_queue('https://sqs.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1212121/MyQueueWhichDoesntExist') do
  it { should_not be_policy_statement_action_all_permissions_enabled }
end
```
