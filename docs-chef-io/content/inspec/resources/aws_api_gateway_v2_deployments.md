## Examples

### Test to ensure a deployment ID is available

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_v2_deployments(api_id: 'APP_ID') do
  its('deployment_ids') { should include 'DEPLOYMENT_ID' }
end
```

### Test to verify the deployment status

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_v2_deployments(api_id: 'APP_ID') do
  its('deployment_statuses') { should include 'DEPLOYED' }
end
```

### Test to ensure an authorizer type has `JWT`

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_v2_deployments(api_id: 'APP_ID') do
  its('authorizer_types') { should include 'JWT' }
end
```

### Test to ensure a description is available

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_v2_deployments(api_id: 'APP_ID') do
  its('descriptions') { should include 'DEPLOYMENT_DESCRIPTION' }
end
```

### Test to ensure an auto-deployment is enabled for a deployment

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_v2_deployments(api_id: 'APP_ID') do
  its('auto_deployeds') { should include true }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

The control passes if the `get` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_v2_deployments(api_id: 'APP_ID') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

### not exists

Use `should_not` to test that the entity does not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_api_gateway_v2_deployments(api_id: 'APP_ID') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
