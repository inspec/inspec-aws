Use the `aws_synthetics_canary` Chef InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS Synthetics Canary.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on the `AWS::Synthetics::Canary` resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-synthetics-canary.html).

## Install

```ruby
describe aws_synthetics_canary(name: 'CANARY_NAME') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

`name` _(required)_

: The name of the canary.

## Properties

end
```

**Ensure a state is `READY`.**

```ruby
describe aws_synthetics_canary(name: 'CANARY_NAME') do
  its('status.state') { should eq 'READY' }
end
```
