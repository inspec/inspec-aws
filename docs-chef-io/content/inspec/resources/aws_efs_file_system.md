Use the `aws_efs_file_system` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of a single AWS EFS file system.
This resource is added to InSpec AWS resource pack in version **[1.10.0](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-aws/releases/tag/v1.10.0)** and it is available with InSpec **[4.18.108](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/releases/tag/v4.18.108)** and later versions. 

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

An `aws_efs_file_system` resource block declares the tests for a single AWS EFS file system by either file system id or creation token.

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_system(file_system_id: 'fs-12345678') do
  it                         { should be_encrypted }
  its('size_in_bytes.value') { should cmp 6144 }
end
```

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_system(creation_token: 'my-token') do
  its('encrypted')       { should cmp true }
  its('throughput_mode') { should eq 'bursting' }
end
```

The value of the `file_system_id` can be provided as a string.  

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_system('fs-12345678') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

Either the EFS file system id or creation token must be provided.

`file_system_id` _(required if `creation_token` not provided)_

: The ID of the EFS file system. This is in the format of `fs-` followed by 8 or 17 hexadecimal characters.
  This can be passed either as a string or as a `file_system_id: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

`creation_token` _(required if `file_system_id` not provided)_

: The creation token is automatically assigned by AWS if not provided by the user at creation. 
  This is a string with minimum 1 and maximum 64-character long.
  This must be passed as a `creation_token: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

## Properties

`creation_token`
: The value of the creation token.

`file_system_id`
: The id of the file system which is auto-assigned by the AWS.

`encrypted`
: Indicates whether the file system is encrypted or not.

`life_cycle_state`
: The lifecycle phase of the file system, e.g. 'creating'.

`owner_id`
: The AWS account that created the file system.

`performance_mode`
: The performance mode of the file system, e.g. 'maxIO'.

`throughput_mode`
: The throughput mode for a file system, e.g. 'bursting'.

`tags`
: An hash with each key-value pair corresponding to a tag associated with the entity.

There are also additional properties available. For a comprehensive list, see [the API reference documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/API_FileSystemDescription.html)

## Examples

**Test that an EFS file system is available.**

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_system("fs-12345678") do
    its("life_cycle_state") { should eq 'available' }
end
```


**Test that an EFS file system is in 'maxIO' performance mode.**

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_system(creation_token: "My Token") do
    its("performance_mode") { should eq "maxIO" }
end
```

**Test that an EFS file system has a certain tag.**

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_system(creation_token: "My Token") do
    its("tags") { should include("companyName" => "My Company") }
end
```
