## Examples

**Ensure an user is available.**

```ruby
describe aws_transfer_user(server_id: "SERVER_ID", user_name: 'USER_NAME') do
  its('user_name') { should eq 'USER_NAME' }
end
```

**Ensure that the server ID is available.**

```ruby
describe aws_transfer_user(server_id: "SERVER_ID", user_name: 'USER_NAME') do
    its('server_id') { should eq 'SERVER_ID' }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

```ruby
describe aws_transfer_user(server_id: "SERVER_ID", user_name: 'USER_NAME') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_transfer_user(server_id: "SERVER_ID", user_name: 'USER_NAME') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the user is available.

```ruby
describe aws_transfer_user(server_id: "SERVER_ID", user_name: 'USER_NAME') do
  it { should be_available }
end
```
