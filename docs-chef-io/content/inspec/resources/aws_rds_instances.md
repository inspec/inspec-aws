Use the `aws_rds_instances` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a collection of AWS RDS instances.

RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server.

RDS instances are compute instances used by the RDS service.

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

Ensure you have exactly 3 instances

```ruby
describe aws_rds_instances do
  its('db_instance_identifiers.count') { should cmp 3 }
end
```

## Parameters

This resource does not require any parameters.

## Properties

`db_instance_identifiers`
: The unique IDs of the RDS Instances returned.

`db_instance_classes`
: The list of the name of the compute and memory capacity class of the DB instances.

`db_security_groups`
: A list of DB security group elements containing `DBSecurityGroup.Name` and `DBSecurityGroup.Status` subelements.

`vpc_security_groups`
: Provides a list of VPC security group elements that the DB instance belongs to.

`entries`
: Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes.

See the [AWS RDS DBInstance API documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_DBInstance.html) for more information.

## Examples

**Ensure a specific instance exists.**

```ruby
describe aws_rds_instances do
  its('db_instance_identifiers') { should include 'rds-12345678' }
end
```

**Use the InSpec resource to request the IDs of all RDS instances, then test in-depth using `aws_rds_instance` to ensure all instances are encrypted and have a sensible size.**

```ruby
aws_rds_instances.db_instance_identifiers.each do |db_instance_identifier|
  describe aws_rds_instance(db_instance_identifier) do
    it { should be_encrypted }
  end
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

This resource has the following special matchers.

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_rds_instances do
  it { should exist }
end
```

```ruby
describe aws_rds_instances do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
