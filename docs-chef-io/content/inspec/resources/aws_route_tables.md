Use the `aws_route_tables` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of all route tables or a group of route tables, and all routes or a group of routes. A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on route tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-route-table.html).

## Examples

**Confirm that a route table exists.**

```ruby
describe aws_route_tables do
  its('vpc_ids') { should include 'VPC_ID' }
end
```

**Confirm a route table exists.**

```ruby
describe aws_route_tables do
  its('route_table_ids') { should include 'ROUTE_TABLE_ID' }
end
```

**Confirm a destination_cidr_blocks is there in the routes.**

```ruby
describe aws_route_tables do
  its('destination_cidr_blocks') { should include "IPV4_CIDR_BLOCK" }
end
```

**Ensure subnet ID of interest is associated .**

```ruby
describe aws_route_tables do
  its('associated_subnet_ids') { should include 'SUBNET_ID' }
end
```

**Filter only main route tables.**

```ruby
describe aws_route_tables.where(main: true) do
  it { should exist }
end
```

**Filter all failed associations.**

```ruby
describe aws_route_tables.where{ association_states.include?('associated') } do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Matchers

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should` to test the entity should not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_route_tables do
  it { should exist }
end
```
