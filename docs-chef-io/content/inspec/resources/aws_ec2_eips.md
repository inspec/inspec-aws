## Syntax

Verify that a public IP address exists.

```ruby
describe aws_ec2_eips do
  it { should exist }
end

## Examples

**Ensure a Elastic IP(EIP) has Public IP.**

```ruby
describe aws_ec2_eips do
  it { should exist }
end
```

**Match count of Elastic IP(EIP).**

```ruby
describe aws_ec2_eips do
    its('count') { should eq 5 }
end
```

**Check Allocation ID whether it is correct or not.**

```ruby
describe aws_ec2_eips do
   its('allocation_ids') { should include "eipassoc-0ew2bc8cde18191da" }
end
```

## Matchers
