## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

**Test that an IAM user does not exist.**

```ruby
describe aws_iam_user(user_name: 'invalid-user') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

**Test that an IAM user has MFA enabled.**

```ruby
describe aws_iam_user('psmith') do
  it { should exist }
  it { should have_mfa_enabled }
end
```

**Ensure a User has no Access Keys or Inline Policies.**

```ruby
describe aws_iam_user('psmith') do
  it                         { should exist }
  its('access_keys')         { should be_empty }
  its('inline_policy_names') { should be_empty }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

This resource has the following special matchers.

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

```ruby
it { should exist }
```

#### has_mfa_enabled

This will check if the requested User has Multi Factor Authentication enabled.

```ruby
it { should have_mfa_enabled }
```


#### has_console_password

This will ensure the User has a console password set.

```ruby
it { should have_console_password }
```
