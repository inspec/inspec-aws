Use the `aws_api_gateway_deployments` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS ApiGateway Deployments.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS ApiGateway Deployment documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-deployment.html).
