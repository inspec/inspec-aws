{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

An `aws_iam_groups` resource block identifies a group by group name.

```ruby
describe aws_iam_groups('mygroup') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

    # Hash syntax for group name
```ruby
describe aws_iam_groups(group_name: 'mygroup') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

This resource does not require any parameters.

## Properties

`group_names`
: The group name.

`group_ids`
: The group ID.

`arns`
: The Amazon Resource Name of the group.

`users`
: Array of users associated with the group.

`entries`
: Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes.

`has_inline_policies`
: Boolean indicating whether or not the group has policies applied to it.

`inline_policy_names`

## Examples

```ruby
describe aws_iam_groups do
  it                 { should exist }
  its('group_names') { should include 'prod-access-group' }
end
```

**Ensure there are no groups with inline policies.**

```ruby
describe aws_iam_groups.where(has_inline_policies: true) do
  its('group_names') { should be_empty }
end
```

## Matchers
