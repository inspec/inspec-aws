Use the `aws_ec2_eip_association` InSpec audit resource to test properties of the singular resource of AWS Elastic IP association.

An Elastic IP (EIP) is uniquely identified by the public IPv4 address, for example `association_id`.

`association_id` _(required)_

The association ID for the address.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on AWS Elastic IP association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-eip-association.html).
