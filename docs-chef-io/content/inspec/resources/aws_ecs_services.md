Use the `aws_ecs_services` InSpec audit resource to test properties of multiple AWS ECS Services.

The AWS ECS Service resource creates an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service that runs and maintains the requested number of tasks and associated load balancers.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on ECS Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-service.html).

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

Ensure that a service exists.

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_services(cluster: "CLUSTER_NAME") do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

`cluster` _(required)_

: The short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster on which your service is running.

## Properties

`service_arns`
: The ARNs of the services.

`service_names`
: The names of the services.

`cluster_arns`
: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that hosts the services.

`status`
: The status of the service. The valid values are `ACTIVE`, `DRAINING`, or `INACTIVE`.

`desired_count`
: The desired number of instantiations of the task definition to keep running on the service.

`running_count`
: The number of tasks in the cluster that are in the `RUNNING` state.

`pending_count`
: The number of tasks in the cluster that are in the `PENDING` state.

`launch_types`
: The infrastructure on which your service is running.

`task_definitions`
: The task definitions to use for tasks in the service.

`platform_versions`
: The AWS Fargate platform versions on which the tasks in the task set are running.

For additional information, see the [AWS documentation on ECS describe services method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v2/api/Aws/ECS/Client.html#describe_services-instance_method).

## Examples

**Ensure a specific service is available on a cluster.**

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_services(cluster: "CLUSTER_NAME") do
  its('service_arns') { should include 'SERVICE_ARN' }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_services(cluster: "CLUSTER_NAME") do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_services(cluster: "CLUSTER_NAME") do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the service is available.

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_services(cluster: "CLUSTER_NAME") do
  it { should be_available }
end
```
