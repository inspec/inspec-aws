The AWS Config service can monitor and record changes to your AWS resource configurations. A Delivery Channel can record the changes
to an S3 Bucket, an SNS or both.

Use the `aws_config_delivery_channel` InSpec audit resource to examine how the AWS Config service delivers those change notifications.

One delivery channel is allowed per region per AWS account, and the delivery channel is required to use AWS Config.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on Delivery Channels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/manage-delivery-channel.html).

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

```ruby
describe aws_config_delivery_channel('my_channel') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

```ruby
describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my-channel') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Since you may only have one Delivery Channel per region, and InSpec connections are per-region, you may also omit the `channel_name` to obtain the one Delivery Channel (if any) that exists:

```ruby
describe aws_config_delivery_channel do
  it { should exist }
end
```

## Parameters

`channel_name` _(optional)_

: This resource accepts a single parameter, the channel name.
  This can be passed either as a string or as a `channel_name: 'value'` key-value entry in a hash.

## Properties

`channel_name`
: The name of the delivery channel. By default, AWS Config assigns the name "default" when creating the delivery channel.

`s3_bucket_name`
: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to which AWS Config delivers configuration snapshots and configuration history files.

`s3_key_prefix`
: The prefix for the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

`sns_topic_arn`
: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which AWS Config sends notifications about configuration changes.

`delivery_frequency_in_hours`
: Specifies how often the AWS Config sends configuration changes to the s3 bucket in the delivery channel.

## Examples

**Test how frequently the channel writes configuration changes to the s3 bucket.**

```ruby
describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my-recorder') do
  its('delivery_frequency_in_hours') { should be > 3 }
end
```

**Ensure configuration change notifications are being delivered to the correct bucket and key.**

```ruby
describe aws_config_delivery_channel(channel_name: 'my_channel')
  its('s3_bucket_name') { should eq 'my_bucket' }
  its('s3_key_prefix')  { should eq 'logs/' }
end
```

## Matchers

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_config_delivery_channel('my_channel') do
  it { should exist }
end
```

```ruby
describe aws_config_delivery_channel('my-nonexistent-channel') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
