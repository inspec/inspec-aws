Use the `aws_ecs_service` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single AWS ECS Service.

The AWS ECS Service resource creates an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) service that runs and maintains the requested number of tasks and associated load balancers.

For additional information, including details on parameters and properties, see the [AWS documentation on ECS Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-service.html).

## Examples

**Ensure a work group name is available.**

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_service(cluster: "default", service: "SERVICE_ARN") do
  its('service_name') { should eq 'service_name' }
end
```

**Ensure that the status is `ACTIVE` or not.**

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_service(cluster: "default", service: "SERVICE_ARN") do
    its('status') { should eq 'ACTIVE' }
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}}

The controls will pass if the `describe` method returns at least one result.

### exist

Use `should` to test that the entity exists.

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_service(cluster: "CLUSTER_NAME", service: "SERVICE_ARN") do
  it { should exist }
end
```

Use `should_not` to test the entity does not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_service(cluster: "CLUSTER_NAME", service: "SERVICE_NAME") do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

### be_available

Use `should` to check if the services is available.

```ruby
describe aws_ecs_service(cluster: "default", service: "SERVICE_ARN") do
  it { should be_available }
end
```
