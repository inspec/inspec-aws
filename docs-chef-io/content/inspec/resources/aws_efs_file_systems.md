Use the `aws_efs_file_systems` InSpec audit resource to test the properties of some or all AWS EFS file systems. To audit a single EFS file system, use `aws_efs_file_ststem` (singular). 

This resource is added to InSpec AWS resource pack in version **[1.10.0](https://github.com/inspec/inspec-aws/releases/tag/v1.10.0)** and it is available with InSpec **[4.18.108](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/releases/tag/v4.18.108)** and later versions.

## Install

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/resources/reusable/md/inspec_aws_install.md" >}}

## Syntax

An `aws_efs_file_systems` resource block collects a group of EFS file system descriptions and then tests that group.

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_systems
  it { should exist }
end   
```

## Parameters

This resource does not require any parameters.

## Properties

`tags`
: The list of tags that the EFS file system has.

`names`
: The value of the `Name` (case sensitive) tag if it is defined.

`file_system_ids`
: The ID of the EFS file system.

`creation_tokens`
: The creation token that the EFS file system is associated.

`owner_ids`
: The owner id of the EFS file system.

`entries`
: Provides access to the raw results of the query, which can be treated as an array of hashes.

`creation_times`
: The creation time of the EFS file system.

`performance_modes`
: The performance mode of the EFS file system, e.g. 'maxIO'.

`encryption_status`
: This indicates whether the EFS file system is encrypted or not.

`throughput_modes`
: The throughput mode of the EFS file system.

`kms_key_ids`
: The ID of an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master key (CMK) that was used to protect the encrypted EFS file system.

`size_in_bytes`
: The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the file system, in its `value` field.

`life_cycle_states`
: The life cycle phase of the EFS file system, e.g. 'deleting'.

## Examples

**Ensure you have exactly 3 file systems.**

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_systems do
  its("entries.count") { should cmp 3 }
end
```

**Use this InSpec resource to request the IDs of all EFS file systems, then test in-depth using `aws_efs_file_system`.**

```ruby
aws_efs_file_systems.file_system_ids.each do |file_system_id|
  describe aws_efs_file_system(file_system_id) do
    its("tags") { should include("companyName" => "My Company Name") }
    it { should be_encrypted }
    its("throughput_mode") { should eq "bursting" }
    its("performance_mode") { should eq "generalPurpose" }
  end
end
```

## Matchers

{{< readfile file="content/inspec/reusable/md/inspec_matchers_link.md" >}} 

### exist

The control will pass if the describe returns at least one result.

Use `should_not` to test the entity should not exist.

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_systems.where( <property>: <value>) do
  it { should exist }
end
```

```ruby
describe aws_efs_file_systems.where( <property>: <value>) do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```
